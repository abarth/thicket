{"id":"TH-sv92nr","title":"Centralize global flag definitions","description":"Currently, global flags like --data-dir and --json are defined in both cmd/thicket/main.go and internal/commands/commands.go (newFlagSet). This duplication is fragile. We should centralize the definition and parsing of global flags, perhaps in internal/config or a dedicated package, so that all commands and main.go share the same source of truth for these flags.","type":"","status":"open","priority":4,"labels":null,"assignee":"","created":"2026-01-26T21:20:27.68617Z","updated":"2026-01-26T21:20:27.68617Z"}
